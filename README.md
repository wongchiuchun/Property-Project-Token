# Udacity Blockchain Capstone Project

This is a project to showcase a ERC721 token that could be minted if the user provides a proof that he/she could verified through a built in ZK-snark function which was generated by Zokrates.

# Get Started

To install project dependancies, run npm install

# Testing of the contracts

There are three test files which test the ERC721 contract, the Verifier function and the combined contract respectively. To test, run truffe test

NB: Due to project requirement and for easier testing, the current contract has a public mint function which allows the contract owner to by pass the verifier function and mint tokens directly. For actual use you should change the property of the mint function

# Sample deployed contract address

An instance of the contract deployed to the Rinkeby testnet could be found here: 

Token:

https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x51201f63c424c4a324f81af235dc08ef6e42c96d

Verifier:

https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x354c4426faE6c674b4774D7E4105677F6fE56418

# Contract ABI

To find the contract ABI, please go to the build folder => contracts => choose the contract JSON file that you want to retrieve the ABI of. You should find the ABI under contract name <"abi":[abi]>.

# Opensea   

Opensea is an open platform that allows you to trade your ERC721 token. An example using the token could be found here:

https://rinkeby.opensea.io/accounts/0xca137d5cd969546ed2bbce75c7d25a6c1d364440

1o tokens were minted, 5 of which was put up for sale and sold to another account
